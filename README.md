This is a very simplistic version of my 2023 resume.

The menu sticks to the top of the page when you scroll down.

The pictures opens in a modal to appear bigger.

The skill section is in a grid with borders for now i don't know what to do with them yet. The progress bars might get a better design. I'm not thrilled of how it looks, especially the positions.

The contact form is in progress I'll do it when I have the time. Technically the CSS is done i just have to do the php.
